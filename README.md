# ps-user-scripts
This repository stores the startup scripts for my Windows PowerShell.

The main <code> Microsoft_PowerShell_profile.ps1 </code> calls to the <code> user_profile.ps1 </code> file to take all the commands from there and use them. I made this work with the latest version of PowerShell on Windows 10. I will update these files once I think of more aliases and other useful things I want to make permanent.
